# **Prompt Journey: The Construction of the Ebook "The New Language of the Future"**

This document details the sequence of prompts used to conceive, structure, and design the ebook "The New Language of the Future." The progression of commands illustrates a complete creation process, from the initial strategy to the refinement of aesthetic details.

---

## **Phase 1: Conception and Verbal Strategy**
*In this phase, the focus was on defining the name, audience, and tone of the ebook.*

> `Case: I'm going to create an ebook about prompt engineering. I need an impactful, thematic, and attention-grabbing name`

> `give me names to entice a general audience that is not familiar with technical terms`

> `The New Language of the Future. Understand how to communicate with artificial intelligence and master this digital revolution`

**Analysis:** The project began with a broad naming request, was refined for a specific audience, and consolidated with your final choice, establishing the foundation of our brand.

## **Phase 2: Content Architecture**
*The focus here was on building the book's backbone, defining the structure of parts and chapters.*

> `give me a roadmap for part 1`

> `make the roadmap more concise, so the common reader doesn't lose interest`

> `Make a roadmap for part 2, taking into account the context of item 3`

> `MAKE A ROADMAP FOR PART 3`

> `is there any other part?`

> `give me the roadmap for chapter 4`

> `give me the roadmap for chapter 2 again`

**Analysis:** You used prompts to methodically build the book's structure, requesting roadmaps and refining them to ensure a logical and engaging reading flow.

## **Phase 3: Title and Tone Refinement**
*In this phase, the attention turned to ensuring the language of the titles was cohesive and sophisticated.*

> `make the title of chapter 1, a little more sophisticated`

> `Make variations based on this title: AI has learned to create. Now what?`

> `let's go back to talking about the chapter names`

> `change the name of part 2`

> `Learning the Alphabet (...), make this one simpler`

> `be creative and sophisticated`

> `The Architecture of the Request`

> `let's refine`

> `part 2 is called The Architecture of the Request`

**Analysis:** This sequence demonstrates a high-level refinement process, where you were not content with the first option but actively sought to elevate the work's tone, resulting in stronger and more aligned titles.

---

## **Phase 4: Design and Visual Identity**
*Here, the focus shifted to the ebook's visual aesthetic, from typography to page layout and graphic elements.*

> `What font should I use for the text pages to follow the aesthetic?`

> `playfair display will be used in the titles`

> `how to improve the text pages`

> `give me ideas on how to make the layout more complete`

> `I want you to give me ideas so the reading doesn't get tiring, having visual elements or something of the sort`

> `read the image and give me icon ideas for this page`

> `about the N, it's the netflix logo`

> `what should I use to differentiate the part 1 page from the chapter page`

> `what do you think?`

**Analysis:** Your prompts guided the creation of a complete visual identity manual. Including images for feedback allowed for an iterative and precise design process, resulting in a professional layout.

---

## **Phase 5: Content, Validation, and Summarization**
*The final phase concentrated on creating text content and consolidating all our progress.*

> `rewrite the parts of the book that you separated`

> `are you sure that's exactly what you told me before?`

> `give me a summary of our conversation so far`

> `give me a summary of everything we've done on the ebook so far`

> `give me the ebook's aesthetic again`

**Analysis:** These final prompts show a concern for content quality and project consistency. The summary requests were crucial for "locking in" decisions and creating reference documents like this one.
